# Arduino 2WD robot drives
> Arduino robot drive controller with automatic drive supply scale by PWM signal. Controller has implemented UP and DOWN ramp to safe
work for DC motor. Controller allows analog steering and is ready to add auto steering with PID regulation.
	
## Drive controller has implemented:
* UP and DOWN adjustable ramp time;
* automatic drive supply scale to nominal voltage by PWM signal;
* left, right, stop and rapid stop move mode;

## To do (development ideas):
* 4WD axis with steering wheel;

## Requirements
* PS2X library from Bill Porter (https://github.com/madsci1016/Arduino-PS2X);
* Chrono library from Sofian Audry and Thomas Ouellet Fredericks (https://github.com/SofaPirate/Chrono);
